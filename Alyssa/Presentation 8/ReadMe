See notes at the top of Jupyter Notebook
Images for this week are the ones Krish extracted in OneDrive (https://nuwildcat-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/akl0407_ads_northwestern_edu/Documents/STAT390/Epithelium_extracted_Krish?csf=1&web=1&e=4yM31x)
This are extracted directly from Prashant's algorithm. Any pictures use with white background are from previous weeks and can be found in those week's folders.
Overall efforts were combined between me/Kenny/Eli for the final algorithm and running the algorithm to upload.
