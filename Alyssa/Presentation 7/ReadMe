Our initial step after adapting my code from last week. Pivoted to using squares instead of shrinking them to rectangles. 
Start with my code, which provides the statistics necessary to determine there is too much variance in patch size to use one patch for all tissues. 
Then see Kenny/Eli's code to see how adusted to patch over more of the epithelium.
