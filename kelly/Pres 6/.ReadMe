### There is one .ipynb file. In the script, 
###I used another folder called 'h1810898B_ROI1' that had 
###three images: the H&e stain, the sox10 stain, and the melana stain. 
###the tif file is too large for the sox10 and melana stain, so i have inserted .jpgs of it instead.
###the original image is downloadable from our sharepoint
