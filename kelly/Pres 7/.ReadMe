'''
This code should complete the process of rotating / flipping / translating. 
it also attempts patching across the different stains.
the images used are in two folders that are too big to put in github. the first is the same folder in my Pres 6.
it is a folder called patient 1, and it is the three different stains of h1810898A ROI_1.
the second folder contains the same images, but i manually flipped the melan-a stain to test if flipping works.
